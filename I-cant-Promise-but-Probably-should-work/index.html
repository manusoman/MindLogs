                <p>Hey folks!</p>
                <p>Have you ever used something without understanding how it works?<br>
                    - Then raise your right leg up (go ahead, do it really).<br>
                    - Then raise your left leg up.<br>
                    - Catch yourself if you fall down.<br>
                    - Finally, continue reading the rest of this article.</p>
                <p>Sounds familiar? Yup, JavaScript Promises.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>I had some difficulty in understanding and using JavaScript Promise when it first appeared. Later I got comfortable using it, although the understanding was still missing. So, in an attempt to bring understanding, I tried to recreate the core functionality of Promise from scratch. It came out well and I realized that Promise was not all that hard!</p>
                <p>I still like the good old callback functions by the way… Well, kind of… I don’t know... Whatever...</p>
                <p>Just a side note: This is not an article about how exactly Promise works. Rather, this is an attempt to write asynchronous code in a synchronous way - just like Promise. Yet, doing so might make Promise clearer to you.</p>
                <p>Let’s first look at how we use a <span class="codeWord">Promise</span> first.</p>

<div class="code"><pre><code class="language-javascript">
    // Create a Promise
    const task = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

        // Use setTimeout to create asynchronicity
        setTimeout(() => {

            // Choose 0 or 1 randomly
            const flag = Math.round(Math.random());

            // Invoke resolve or reject handlers based on flag
            flag ? resolve('Success!') : reject(new Error('Oops!'));

        }, 1000);
    });


    // Add custom resolve and reject handlers
    task.then(console.log)
    .catch(console.error)
    .finally(() => console.log('Meh...'));

</code></pre></div>

                <p>A new <span class="codeWord">Promise</span> is created and passed in the executor function. I used <span class="codeWord">setTimout</span> to create an asynchronous operation and then called the <span class="codeWord">resolve</span>/<span class="codeWord">reject</span> handlers based on the value of the <span class="codeWord">flag</span> variable.</p>
                <p> Wait a second... Are <span class="codeWord">const</span> variables variables? They can’t vary!</p>
                <p>Next, the <span class="codeWord">then</span>, <span class="codeWord">catch</span> and <span class="codeWord">finally</span> methods are used to pass in the <span class="codeWord">resolve</span>, <span class="codeWord">reject</span> and "<span class="codeWord">finally</span>" handlers (I call it <span class="codeWord">endTask</span>) to the <span class="codeWord">Promise</span>. These handlers will be executed based on the output of the asynchronous executor function. This is the core of a JavaScript Promise.</p>
                <h2>Now, how can we do this ourselves, Probably?</h2>
                <p>Let’s start with a question. In the previous example, the executor function will be executed immediately after the <span class="codeWord">Promise</span> is created (that’s the requirement). But how does that work since we haven’t provided those <span class="codeWord">resolve</span> and <span class="codeWord">reject</span> parameters yet?!</p>
                <p>Simple. Just create default <span class="codeWord">resolve</span> and <span class="codeWord">reject</span> handlers and pass them on to the executor. Once the executor is run and produces an output (or error) the default handlers should store them on the object. Whenever the user sets their own <span class="codeWord">resolve</span> and <span class="codeWord">reject</span> handlers, simply call those with the stored output. Ta-da… Just as Promised! This resolved the mystery of Promise for me.</p>
                <p>Alright then, let’s recreate this baby (no, that’s not what I meant). But what do we name him? ...her? Anyway, I’m very modest about my programming skills. Hence, it’s not wise for me to Promise or Ensure or Guarantee or Swear or anything. Instead, I name it <strong>Probably</strong>. Yes, I just used an adverb as noun, because now I can cleverly say,</p>
                <p>"Oh yeah... This Probably should work!"</p>
                <p>Let’s jump into the code, the Probably constructor first. I still use the old-style function constructors to create objects (perhaps I’m not class-y). We won’t be doing error handling and other checks here in order to simplify the code (who’d wanna do error handling anyway? Such a waste of time...).</p>
                
<div class="code"><pre><code class="language-javascript">
    // The Probably constructor
    function Probably(executor) {
    
        // "Pending" is always the initial state
        this.state = 'pending';
    
        // Properties to store users' handlers
        // from then, catch and finally methods
        this.resolve = null;
        this.reject = null;
        this.endTask = null;
    
        executor(

            // Default resolve handler
            (val) => {
                this.value = val;
                this.state = 'fulfilled';
                this.resolve && this.resolve(val);
                this.endTask && this.endTask();
            },

            // Default reject handler
            (err) => {
                this.reason = err;
                this.state = 'rejected';
                this.reject && this.reject(err);
                this.endTask && this.endTask();
            }
        );
    }

</code></pre></div>

                <p>Just like Promises, Probably can have three states. "<span class="codeWord">pending</span>" is always the initial state. Later, the state changes to either "<span class="codeWord">fulfilled</span>" or "<span class="codeWord">rejected</span>" based on which default handler is called by the executor function. We also add three properties <span class="codeWord">resolve</span>, <span class="codeWord">reject</span> and <span class="codeWord">endTask</span> to store the respective handlers when the user adds them through <span class="codeWord">then</span>, <span class="codeWord">catch</span> and <span class="codeWord">finally</span>.</p>
                <p>The <span class="codeWord">executor</span> function is run next and the default <span class="codeWord">resolve</span> and <span class="codeWord">reject</span> handlers are passed as parameters. When the result is obtained, first it gets stored in the object and then the related user provided handler is called and the result is passed. Note that for storing the result, we’re creating a property as either "<span class="codeWord">value</span>" or "<span class="codeWord">reason</span>"  for <span class="codeWord">resolve</span> or <span class="codeWord">reject</span> respectively.</p>
                <p>And next, we build the prototype for Probably.</p>

<div class="code"><pre><code class="language-javascript">
    Probably.prototype = {

        constructor : Probably,
    
        then : function(resolve, reject) {
            this.resolve = resolve;    
            this.value && resolve(this.value);    
            reject && this.catch(reject);
            return this;
        },
    
        catch : function(reject) {
            this.reject = reject;    
            this.reason && reject(this.reason);    
            return this;
        },
    
        finally : function(endTask) {
            this.endTask = endTask;
            this.state !== 'pending' && endTask();
        }
    };

</code></pre></div>

                <p>I think the prototype is self explanatory. Receive the <span class="codeWord">resolve</span>, <span class="codeWord">reject</span> and <span class="codeWord">endtask</span> handlers through <span class="codeWord">then</span>, <span class="codeWord">catch</span> and <span class="codeWord">finally</span> methods respectively and store them on the object instance. If the result or error from the executor function is available, just pass it on to the relevant handlers. Both <span class="codeWord">then</span> and <span class="codeWord">catch</span> returns the object instance to enable method chaining (<span class="codeWord">then().catch().finally()</span>). Note that this simple implementation doesn’t work with multiple <span class="codeWord">then</span> chains as seen in Promises - I’m not going that deep here. But yet, I made the <span class="codeWord">then</span> method accept the <span class="codeWord">reject</span> handler as well in order to make <span class="codeWord">Probably</span> behave like a <span class="codeWord">Promise</span> more.</p>
                <p>And in the <span class="codeWord">finally</span> method, we check whether <span class="codeWord">Probably</span> has settled by looking at the <span class="codeWord">state</span> property. The <span class="codeWord">state</span> won't be "<span class="codeWord">pending</span>" if <span class="codeWord">Probably</span> has settled - so execute the <span class="codeWord">endTask</span> handler.</p>
                <p>Now that we have set up <span class="codeWord">Probably</span>, let's see it in action. I'm using the same code we wrote for <span class="codeWord">Promise</span>.</p>
                <p> Would it work? Probably.</p>

<div class="code"><pre><code class="language-javascript">
    // Create a Probably object
    const task = new Probably((resolve, reject) => {

        // Use setTimeout to create asynchronicity
        setTimeout(() => {

            // Choose 0 or 1 randomly
            const flag = Math.round(Math.random());

            // Invoke resolve or reject handlers based on flag
            flag ? resolve('Success!') : reject(new Error('Oops!'));

        }, 1000);
    });


    // Add custom resolve and reject handlers
    task.then(console.log)
    .catch(console.error)
    .finally(() => console.log('Meh...'));

                <p>I'm not sure about you, but it works on my machine.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, I'm damn sure that this great article made you understand what it means to write asynchronous code synchronously, and shed light on what JavaScript Promises really are. Come back for more such great learning resources as I publish them (sorry, my modesty just took a tea break).</p>
                <p>Cheers!</p>
